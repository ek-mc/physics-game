# Changelog

## [Unreleased]

## [0.6.4] - 2026-03-05
### Added
- Home-screen keyboard shortcuts for chapter buttons:
  - `K` Κινηματική, `D` Δυναμική, `P` Περιστροφή, `E` Έργο & Ενέργεια, `T` Τύποι, `M` Τυχαίο
  - includes Greek key fallback (`κ,δ,π,ε,τ,μ`).
- Result-screen `Space` shortcut now triggers **Νέο Quiz**.

### Changed
- Added letter hints directly in chapter button labels (e.g. `K) Κινηματική`).

## [0.6.3] - 2026-03-05
### Changed
- Simplified `v-t` graph labels to avoid revealing the numeric answer directly.
- Kept only symbolic labels (`v₀`, `a`, `t`, `v(t)`) for cleaner exam-like visuals.

## [0.6.2] - 2026-03-05
### Fixed
- `v-t` graph now reflects each question's actual parameters (`v₀`, `a`, `t`), including negative slope cases (`a<0`).
- Added dynamic labels on graph (`v₀`, `t`, `v(t)`, `a`) for better correspondence with prompt text.

## [0.6.1] - 2026-03-05
### Fixed
- A/B/C/D keyboard answer shortcuts now work regardless of keyboard layout (uses physical key codes + Greek character fallback).

## [0.6.0] - 2026-03-05
### Changed
- Upgraded kinematics `v-t` graph visuals (dark chart card, grid lines, highlighted endpoints, and clearer axis/point labels) for better readability.

## [0.5.9] - 2026-03-05
### Fixed
- Added actual graph visuals to numeric kinematics graph questions (`v-t`) so "Γραφικά" prompts always display a chart.
- Removed elevator context from linear-kinematics word-problem pool to keep scenarios more natural.

## [0.5.8] - 2026-03-05
### Changed
- Replaced vague phrase "Στην ίδια κίνηση" with explicit problem-style circular-motion wording.
- Polished paired uniform-rotation prompts for consistency and clarity.

## [0.5.7] - 2026-03-05
### Added
- Keyboard answer shortcuts: pressing `A` / `B` / `C` / `D` selects the corresponding choice.
- Keeps existing `Space` shortcut for next question.

## [0.5.6] - 2026-03-05
### Changed
- Rewrote no-time train prompt to a more problem-like Greek wording.

### Added
- Added opposite-sign kinematics variant: `v<0, a>0` -> behavior of `|v|`.

## [0.5.5] - 2026-03-05
### Changed
- Stats panel now shows **Global max streak** independently from global-best score record, to avoid confusion when a high-score run has lower streak.

## [0.5.4] - 2026-03-05
### Fixed
- Removed remaining old circular-motion prompt variant from idea-question set.
- Replaced with the new precise pair (constant non-zero `ω` and zero `α`).

## [0.5.3] - 2026-03-05
### Fixed
- Global best logic now prioritizes highest **correct answers count** (e.g. 19/20 beats 10/10 in global panel), then accuracy, then streak.
- Clarified global-best label text in UI.

## [0.5.2] - 2026-03-05
### Changed

## [0.5.1] - 2026-03-05
### Changed

### Fixed
- Reworded ambiguous kinematics prompt ("αλλάζει πορεία") to explicit straight-line motion wording.

## [0.4.5] - 2026-03-05
### Added
- Enriched **Τύποι (mixed)** with concept-symbol questions (e.g. `a` = επιτάχυνση, `v` = ταχύτητα, `x` = θέση, `t` = χρόνος, `g`, `m`, `W`, `P`, `U`).
